# Medical-Image-Denosing-using-UNet model 


In this notebook, I've implemented the following paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04667. The aim is to contruct a denoising autoencoder yielding superior results than that from Median filtering. Dental X-ray dataset is used for training and testing.

For the Dataset use this Kaggle code-

#import kagglehub
#path = kagglehub.dataset_download("parthplc/medical-image-dataset")
#print("Path to dataset files:", path)
